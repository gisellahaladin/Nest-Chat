# Chatbot built with Cord and OpenAI

This repo is a template to create an AI Chatbot using [openAI](https://openai.com/) and [Cord](https://cord.com/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot).
It's prebuilt with the context about Cord, the collaboration product (not the recruiting one).

# How does it work?

Essentially, you give the bot context on what it knows (its context), and you tell it how to behave,
(it's prompt), then you give it the back-and-forths of a conversation, starting with the user's
first message, and then use OpenAI's chat completion API to fill in the next message.

This library helps you with:

- Generating embeddings from a list of URLs
- Creating a prompt for the bot
- Selecting context data for the bot (using embeddings and cosine similarity)

The client interface is using Cord's SDK to simulate a chatbot. The components from the SDK used are:

- [Thread](https://docs.cord.com/components/cord-thread?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot)
- [Presence Observer](https://docs.cord.com/components/cord-presence-observer?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot)
- [Presence Facepile](https://docs.cord.com/components/cord-presence-facepile?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot)

Server side the following is used:

- [Cord webhook](https://docs.cord.com/reference/events-webhook?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot) is used to get the message content of what the user (you) are asking the bot.
- [Cord REST APIs](https://docs.cord.com/rest-apis?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot) - including users, organizations, threads, typing indicators, and user presence.

# Local set up

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into cord-openai-chatbot

## Set up local server

After cloning the repo, in your Terminal:

2. `cd` into the server folder.

3. Run `npm install`.

   ```
   ðŸ’¡ Make sure you run npm install within the server folder
   ```

4. Run `npm run generate-dot-env` to generate `.env` template.

5. Enter missing information in `.env`.\
    **Cord credentais**\
    You can find them [here](https://console.cord.com/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot) or [sign up](https://console.cord.com/signup?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot) to get them.\
    \
    **openAI credentials**\
    You can find them [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) or sign up to get them.\
   \
    **email address**\
    The email address associated to the user who is talking to the chat bot (you will receive notifications).

6. Run `npm run dev` and your server should be started!

> _Note_ Any changes you make to the server code will only be reflected if you restart your server.

**Specifying the Cord webhook endpoint**

The [webhook](https://docs.cord.com/reference/events-webhook?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot) allows you to receive events from Cord, the types of events you can see can be calibrated in the [Cord Console](https://console.cord.com?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot).

7. If you are running this locally, you will need to open up access to your localhost by using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or something similar.

8. Using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), sign up and follow the instructions to install `ngrok`. \
    Then run in your terminal `ngrok http http://localhost:4000` making sure you insert what is specified in the hostname and port in your `.env`.\
   You will then get a web url (e.g `https://xxxx-217-213-73-197.ngrok-free.app`) that forwards any traffic to your localhost.

   ```
   ðŸ’¡ Make sure your local server is turned at this point, when you insert the URL in the console, we will send a reuest to that URL and expect a status 200 back.
   ```

9. Log into the [Cord Console](https://console.cord.com?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_chatbot) and select the application you will use, then navigate to app settings, and then to the events tab and enter the webhook url (e.g `https://xxxx-217-213-73-197.ngrok-free.app/cord-webhook` from the step above).

   ```
   ðŸ’¡ Make sure your webhook url also includes the CORD_WEBHOOK_PATH value.
   ```

10. You can change the path `/cord-webhook` to anything you want in the `.env` under `CORD_WEBHOOK_PATH`. Make sure you restart your server if you do.

## Set up local client

After cloning the repo, in your Terminal:

11. `cd` into the client folder.

12. Run `npm install`.

13. Create a `.env` in the client folder and add the below into the newly created `.env` file.

```
# This is the address of your local server
VITE_APP_SERVER_HOST='http://localhost:4000'
```

14. Run `npm run dev` and your local client should be set up! Check using the url given in your terminal.

15. You should see the chat load up and a second later the AI bot will send its first message to you.

# How to configure the bot

You can create your own support bot by following the steps below:s

You'll need to change files in `server/botKnowledge`.

## Feeding knowledge

1. In `server/botKnowledge/urls.txt` list all the urls you want the bot to know about.

2. In your terminal run `npm run generate-embeddings` this will take the list of urls and make a get request to extract all the text on that page.
3. In `server/botKnowledge/prompt.txt` you can describe what you require from the bot's response. The `BOT_USER_NAME`, `BOT_ESCAPE_WORD` and `BOT_CONTEXT` are variables that are replaced when the prompt is sent to openAI.

## Change bot appearance

4. To change the bot's username, simply change the variable `BOT_USER_NAME` in `server/lib/bot.ts`.

5. To change the bot's profile picture, replace the image `cordy-avatar.png` in `server/public`.

# Examples

## Pokedex

This takes the first 150 pokemon urls and feeds information to the Cord bot.

1. Replace contents in `server/botKnowledge/urls.txt` with the below:
      <details>
      <summary>Show urls for pokemon</summary>

   You are called BOT_USER_NAME. You are helping someone who is a Pokemon trainer.
   Many of the questions you'll face will be about Pokemon. Do not allow the people you are chatting with to go off
   topic. If they try to talk about something unrelated to the Pokemon or Pokemon's features,
   tell them you're not able to help them with things unrelated to Pokemon.
   Do not use your existing knowledge.
   Do not guess about things -- stick to the documentation.
   Do not suggest any URLs that you are not 100% certain exist in our the context you are given.
   Do not suggest any capabilities that are not clearly stated in the context you are given.
   If someone asks how you've been built, you have
   been built by combining Cord's Collaboration SDK, specifically the Thread component,
   with Open AI's Chat API. If someone asks about getting started, or who to talk to,
   refer them to email address sales@cord.com.

   You have the following context:
